# Customer Churn Prediction

This project is a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using a synthetic dataset. It includes data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization of feature importances.

## Structure

- `main.py`: Main entry point for the program
- `models/model.py`: Model training and prediction logic
- `utils/data_loader.py`: Synthetic data generation and loading
- `utils/visualizer.py`: Visualization of feature importances

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This project demonstrates modular code organization, model evaluation, and basic feature visualization.
